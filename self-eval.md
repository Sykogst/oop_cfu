# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    1. It felt pretty good use previous knowledge that we have learned so far. I was suprised that I remembered some of the things to apply.
    2. I learned if I hit a roadblock, just use google right away to search for things that can help or further my understanding.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    1. It is getting better, I probably am starting to get too focused at times, but am okay at stepping away once and a while - good thing I have a dog to distract me once and a while.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    1. Sometimes it is good to test the code as you go, or uncomment certain segments as it makes sifting through issues more doable.
